# Trees
Trees are a collection of nodes (vertices), and they are linked with edges (pointers), representing the hierarchical connections between the nodes.
## Challenge
the challenge requires to make Binary tree using (pre order ,in order ,post order),, Binary search tree to Add and check of it contain a specific node.
## Approach & Efficiency
big O notation was equal to O(n)
normal functions and loops.

## API
in BinaryTree class there are three methods:
preOrder:return a list contain the tree values in (root,left,right) order.
inOrder: return a list contain the tree values in (left,root,right) order.
postOrder:return a list contain the tree values in (left,right,root) order.
in binarySearchTree class there are two methods:
add:add value to a certain place in the tree where the left node is smaller and the right node is bigger.
contains: search for that value in the tree based on binary search concepts.
