## Approach & Efficiency
in the append part, a new linked list was made and adding a value to the last node, in the addbefore, there where two parameters holding the value that we want to inset anew value before, and the new value itself , and the insert after uses to parameters as well, holding the value and the new value.

## Solution
when run the code, the expected result is to have a linked list, and the nodes can be added before and after it.
