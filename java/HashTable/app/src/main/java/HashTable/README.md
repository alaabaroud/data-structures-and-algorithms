# Hashtables
The Hashtable is so similar to a hashmap, it implements a hash table, which maps keys to values. Any non-null object can be used as a key or as a value. To successfully store and retrieve objects from a hashtable, the objects used as keys must implement the hashCode method and the equals method.
## Challenge
we are required to make method for the hashtable:

add method: to add value to the hashtable.
hash: to hash the given words.
get: to get the hashed value of a specific word.
contains: to check if the hashtable contains a specific word.
## Approach & Efficiency
to run this:
run the intellij normal run button, BUT for the tests, please run it from the file Build.gradle test run.
## API
<!-- Description of each method publicly available in each of your hashtable -->
